This first module, **The Vertigo of Dialogue and Deliberation,** lays the groundwork for understanding participation as a dynamic, unpredictable and constantly changing process, where convictions are continually challenged. 

With the help of several experts, we explore the process of deliberation: first, we discuss the concept of **creative democracy and how it relates to modern democracy**; then, we analyze **the cognitive conditioning factors that hinder participatory processes**; finally, we reflect on **the practice of deliberation and some of its most important aspects.**

## **Creative democracy**

Creative democracy is a modality of participation based on the creative capacity and dynamism of the citizenry to promote transformations and formulate solutions. Cristian Palazzi, in charge of citizen mobilization and advocacy at Platoniq, explains the various ways in which, throughout the history of modern democracy, social rights have been won, highlighting the role of creativity as a fundamental means to achieve them. Today, democracy is overwhelmed, problems are increasingly complex and the laws that govern us no longer serve us. In this sense, **creativity can become a tool through which we can digest this complexity and think of new democratic methodologies.**

The advertising creative Patricia Luján, through her association School of Feminism, illustrates how, through creativity and communication, complex ideas can be disseminated in a simple, clear and accessible way for everyone. **Her advertising campaigns on feminism have been a great success, demonstrating how, by using marketing tools, we can generate far-reaching conversations around more complex ideas.**

## **Deciding changes with words**

Another important concept when we talk about creative democracy is participation and participatory processes. **These processes are mechanisms through which citizens actively intervene in public decision-making.** Ernesto Ganuza, an expert in deliberative democracy and cognitive biases, raises the difficulties that can arise in participatory processes, in relation to cognitive conditioning. 

Traditionally, the participation of non-experts has been underestimated, alleging an inability to reflect and cognitive biases. However, **social psychology shows that all people have cognitive biases.** Speeches do not express an internalized culture, but are arguments in a particular social context, as our minds function by justifying actions. Cognitive biases help us defend ourselves, but make agreement difficult.

Avoiding disagreement implies listening to the voice of people with diverse perspectives and life trajectories, in an egalitarian manner. **The different stages of a participatory process (call for proposals, diagnosis, formulation of proposals, monitoring and follow-up) should be based on this idea.** Thus, when making the sample during the call for proposals, we should try to select people from very different social spaces or strata. The diagnosis helps to understand the individual perspectives on the problem posed, to reach consensus in the formulation of proposals, and finally, to be able to monitor and follow up on the results.

A participatory process also depends on the form of communication, which conditions the way in which we transmit and receive messages. Participation requires a dialogue phase, to build relationships and understanding among participants, and a deliberation phase, to resolve and conclude the process. **The combination of both communication models allows us to rely on mutual understanding, to reach a reasoned consensus, and to avoid falling into a dispute of positions.**

**Deliberation put into practice**

All citizens should have equal opportunities to participate in a deliberative process, however, **it is clear that social and institutional exclusion can be transferred to these spaces.** In this regard, Oliver Escobar, an expert in citizen participation, presents a possible application of compensation strategies through a real case, the Scottish Climate Assembly. In this case, the civic postal lottery system was used, applying positive discrimination, through the selection of 20% of zip codes in more disadvantaged areas. In addition, to eliminate other potential barriers, civil servants and politicians were excluded and a participation fee was established. After a selection based on eight criteria (age, gender, geography, household income, ethnicity, rurality, disability and attitude towards climate change), one hundred and four participants, from different demographics, were selected.

To avoid the exclusion there are several strategies, such as enclave deliberation, where groups with common experiences, such as social marginalization, meet in a safe environment to develop their ideas before participating in the public debate. **Also, positive discrimination seeks to level the playing field by removing structural barriers that limit disadvantaged groups.**

## **Design of a sample**

To conclude the module, we explore the application of the concepts learned through the first deliverable, which proposes the design of a sample of an eventual participatory process. **The objective is to consider how to guarantee an adequate sample for a participatory process and what criteria should be used for this purpose.**
