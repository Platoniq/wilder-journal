**What if democracy were not only about voting, but also about imagining, feeling and creating together?** In a context of crisis of representation, political disengagement and growing polarization, creativity emerges as a key tool to revitalize democratic life. Not as decoration, but as a method to open spaces for participation, build dialogue across difference, and collectively influence institutions.

With this premise, **Platoniq’s School of Creativity and Democracy and the Institute of Government and Public Policy (IGOP) at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona** join forces to launch the **first University Micro-credential in Creative Democracy:** a learning pathway that brings together participatory democracy, civic technology and creative methodologies.

## **Learning democracy in uncertain times**

Democracy is not a closed system. It is a living practice, constantly evolving, and it is learned by practicing it. Today more than ever, we need **new languages, tools and frameworks** that allow us to participate without naïveté, but also without cynicism.

The **University Micro-credential in Creative Democracy** offers a shared learning space to rethink how we make collective decisions, how we deal with conflict, how we organize across diversity, and how we can influence change constructively, from the local to the global level.

This learning pathway consists of **six online sessions**, designed for people who work in or are interested in citizen participation, democratic innovation, community action, culture, education, or communication with social impact.



## **A six-session learning pathway**

### 🎭 **A history of creative democracy**

An exploration of how, throughout the history of modern democracy, social movements have used creativity to win rights. From symbolic action to culture as a political tool, with a focus on imagination as a driver of democratic change.

### 🙊 **Deciding change through words**

How are participatory processes built, and what blocks them? This session examines the stages of citizen participation, common anti-democratic fallacies, and cognitive biases that hinder fair and inclusive deliberation.

### 🛠️ **Deliberation in practice**

Designing spaces for conversation is not enough. We need to design spaces for decision-making. This session explores how citizen dialogues and assemblies are built in contexts of diversity, taking into account enclaves, interest groups and worldviews. Deliberation is not the same as dialogue.

### 👯‍♂️ **Key principles of community participation**

Types and models of citizen and community participation. What do we mean by democratic quality? How do institutional and community dynamics connect? A session focused on grounding concepts and practices in real territories.

### ✊🏽 **Levels of democratic influence**

From the neighborhood to European institutions. This session covers different levels of political influence, the actors involved, and the most appropriate strategies depending on the scale and the issue at stake.

### 📢 **Communication and citizen mobilization**

Narratives, campaigns and tools to generate social impact. A session dedicated to communication as a lever for political mobilization and transformation, from an ethical, creative and democratic perspective.

## **Creative democracy: thinking, feeling and doing together**

This micro-credential is not only an academic program. It is also a **laboratory of democratic practices,** grounded in the experience of Platoniq, IGOP-UAB and international networks of democratic innovation.

It is aimed at activists, professionals from the public and social sectors, educators, researchers, communicators, and anyone interested in **participating in democratic life in a critical, informed and creative way.**

Because democracy is not inherited. **It is built.**

And because, in the face of blockage and resignation, **creativity remains one of our most powerful political tools.**
