We need to start measuring the time we spend doing things. Distinguishing between quality time, functional time, and leisure time is essential to establishing measures that allow us to expand the time available for democracy, which is none other than the time available for deliberation and participation. Below, we present the results of research on **Deep Time and Citizen Participation,** based on work carried out by Eurostat in HETUS (Harmonized European Time Use Surveys), which seeks to understand how both citizens and public workers use their time in relation to democratic practice.

## **State of the Art in Deep Time and Citizen Participation**

### **Perception of Time: A Contemporary Challenge**

The survey reveals a widespread perception of time scarcity among participants. This feeling varies significantly depending on factors such as age, geographic location, and personal circumstances. The influence of external elements such as daylight hours and urban rhythms on this perception is noteworthy. A notable finding is how long working hours negatively impact work-life balance.

### **The Quality of Time: In Search of Depth**

Respondents recognize different qualities of time, emphasizing the importance of “deep time.” This concept is associated with moments of tranquility and intense concentration. Technological hyperstimulation and multitasking are identified as major obstacles to achieving this state of temporal depth.

### **Cultural Perspectives: Rethinking Time**

The survey highlights alternative cultural perspectives on time, such as the non-individualistic view of Andean communities. This has inspired proposals to build a sense of community that allows for a more collective and profound experience of time.

### **Innovation in Time Management**

Participants propose creating spaces for knowledge exchange free from strict rules and blocking out specific time for innovation and co-creation. It is suggested to “hack” institutional time to improve participatory and deliberative processes.

### **Deep Time as a Transformative Concept**

The concept of “deep time” emerges as a powerful resource for changing the collective perception of time, with the potential to transcend current conceptions and open up new ways of understanding and experiencing time.

### **Time and Work: An Ongoing Debate**

The survey reflects the historical importance of time in labor struggles, from the 40-hour workweek to retirement. Proposals such as reducing the workweek to 30-32 hours and implementing a Universal Basic Income are discussed.

### **Temporal Inequalities: A Social Challenge**

Disparate temporal experiences are evident, especially for marginalized groups such as migrants and the less privileged. The slowness of administrative processes is perceived as a significant obstacle to the realization of rights.

### **Towards New Ways of Managing Time**

Respondents propose innovative methods for managing time, such as meetings in the form of walks or structuring the work week into thematic blocks. The importance of respecting individual rhythms and concentration needs is emphasized.

### **Cultural Rethinking of Time**

The survey suggests a profound revision of how we measure and conceptualize time, questioning established paradigms such as the Gregorian calendar and exploring concepts of circular or spiral time.

### Time as Vital Rhythm

A vision of time as rhythm emerges, illustrated by community practices that seek to restore personal balance through collective activities, such as the Senegalese example mentioned in the survey.

## **Conclusions**

The results of our survey on Time and Citizen Participation have revealed the critical need to examine how the concept of time influences participatory and deliberative democracy from an intersectional perspective.

It has become clear that time is neither neutral nor equitably distributed in society. Structural inequalities based on race, gender, class, and immigration status create divergent temporal experiences that directly affect the capacity for citizen participation. While marginalized communities experience an acceleration of time due to precariousness, privileged groups enjoy greater temporal autonomy to engage in participatory processes.

These findings have inspired further research that proposes rethinking participatory processes to foster more equitable engagement. Strategies such as the creation of “temporal zones” that allow for the reconciliation of diverse rhythms, as well as the implementation of practices such as radical leisure and care spaces to democratize time, are suggested.

This line of research has been accepted for presentation at the upcoming ECPR conference under the title [“Democracy Takes Time: Intersectional Temporalities in Participation and Deliberation”](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PaperDetails/79797).
