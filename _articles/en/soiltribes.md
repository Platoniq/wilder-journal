**Soil is one of the planet’s most essential and threatened resources.** Every five seconds, the equivalent of a football field of fertile soil is lost. Soil degradation—caused by erosion, pollution, uncontrolled urbanization, and intensive farming practices—jeopardizes not only food security but also biodiversity, climate balance, and the lives of millions of people.

**In response to this crisis, SoilTribes seeks to establish, activate, and strengthen glocal ecosystems for soil values, functions, and connectivity through “Back to the Earth” narratives, building bridges between science, technology, the arts, and community-driven action.** Through knowledge exchange, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community-led initiatives, the project’s mission is to promote a systemic and glocal approach to soil restoration, ensuring its long-term sustainability as a vital resource for future generations.

## **Creating Tribes to Defend the Soil**

At its core, SoilTribes is built as a dynamic network comprising several interconnected groups, each playing a distinct role in promoting soil health.

[The **Community of Practice** ](https://soiltribes.eu/about-the-cop/)is a transnational hub where experts, scientists, artists, educators, policymakers, and citizens converge. Structured around four pillars—Academia, Business, Government, and Society—this community co-designs innovative tools, communication strategies, and policy recommendations to improve soil literacy across and beyond Europe.

At regional and local levels, SoilTribes deploys seven** [Soil Lab Activators](https://commons.soiltribes.eu/assemblies/soillabactivators)** who catalyze innovation through diverse activities and campaigns. From workshops and soil hackathons to creative exhibitions and soil-bombing campaigns, they bring soil-related themes directly to communities, schools, and cultural institutions.

Additionally, seven **[Stewardship Assemblies](https://commons.soiltribes.eu/assemblies/stewardshipAssembly)**, led by municipalities, serve as participatory forums to collaboratively identify and address local soil challenges. They facilitate peer learning, twinning visits, training, and the co-creation of local soil action plans, fostering community ownership of soil stewardship.

## **Soil as a Pillar for Future Generations**

Healthy soils are the foundation of food systems, water regulation, carbon capture, and life on Earth. Yet the FAO warns that one-third of soils are already degraded and that, without action, we may lose most of the fertile layer in less than 60 years.

Soil restoration must be approached systemically, recognizing its role within complex networks of biodiversity, culture, and economy. SoilTribes connects disciplines—from agronomy to the arts—and promotes the co-creation of context-adapted solutions, always focused on the well-being of current and future generations.

## **“Back to the Earth” Narratives: Transforming Our Relationship with Soil**

For soil restoration to be sustainable and systemic, it is not enough to implement technical or policy solutions. We must also transform how we perceive and relate to the Earth. SoilTribes views “Back to the Earth” narratives as a key tool to rebuild the cultural, emotional, and collective connection with the soils we inhabit and depend on.

For decades, soils have been made invisible or reduced to mere extractable resources within extractivist economic models. Yet soil is much more: a living ecosystem, a biological memory, a biodiversity archive, and a space of interaction between human and non-human life.

“Back to the Earth” narratives aim to break this fragmented view and promote a renewed story where soil is understood as a shared heritage, a source of life, nourishment, and ecological balance. Rebuilding this connection involves integrating ancestral knowledge, peasant practices, Indigenous worldviews, and the voices of science, art, and local communities.

These narratives are not built through top-down discourse but through participatory experiences, local stories, artistic expressions, environmental education, and co-creation projects. From rituals honoring the land’s fertility to stories about food sovereignty or territorial struggles, these “Back to the Earth” narratives activate memory, imagination, and collective commitment.

For SoilTribes, fostering these narratives is just as important as physically restoring soils. Only when people understand the deep value of soil and feel responsible for its care can real and lasting transformation take root.

By promoting these stories, the project helps reconnect citizens with the Earth, not through nostalgia, but through shared responsibility, collective knowledge, and glocal action. Going back to the Earth does not mean looking backward—it means building more sustainable, just, and resilient futures where soils are protected, regenerated, and cherished as the essential asset they are.

## **Thinkers Who Inspire: Margulis, Haraway, and Tsing**

SoilTribes draws philosophical and scientific inspiration from visionary thinkers who have challenged the boundaries between nature and culture.

Biologist **Lynn Margulis** transformed our understanding of life by showing that cooperation and symbiosis are evolutionary forces as powerful as competition—a key lesson for thinking of soil as a space of interaction and co-creation among species.

From a different perspective, philosopher and biologist **Donna Haraway** invites us to “stay with the trouble and weave multispecies alliances,” reminding us that soil health requires us to think beyond the human, in a web where worms, microbes, fungi, and plants are essential actors.

Anthropologist **Anna Tsing**, in her work *The Mushroom at the End of the World*, tells how damaged ecosystems can regenerate through networks of care, unexpected cooperation, and foraging at the margins—challenging the extractivist logic dominating the planet. For Tsing, fungi—especially species like Matsutake—teach us that even in the ruins left by capitalism, life persists, adapts, and flourishes through unlikely alliances. Fungi ignore borders and hierarchies; they spread through underground networks, connecting trees and soils in resilient systems.

SoilTribes embraces this lesson to cultivate glocal collaborations from the margins and cracks—helping communities survive and regenerate in a world marked by ecological and economic crises.

## **Culture, Technology, and Community in Service of Restoration**

Glocal soil regeneration requires the integration of ancestral wisdom, technological innovation, and active participation. For this reason, SoilTribes develops open tools for soil diagnostics, collaborative mapping, hybrid training, and community resource banks.

It also fosters cross-disciplinary and cross-sector dialogue, understanding that only a systemic perspective and multi-sectoral alliances can ensure long-term impact. The combination of technology, culture, and community is the key to turning soil care into a daily and global practice.

**Soil cannot be restored without social justice.** SoilTribes advocates for the right to land—its access, care, and collective management—as a prerequisite for ensuring its long-term sustainability. In many regions, land concentration, land grabbing, and the expulsion of rural communities worsen soil degradation and sever the connection between people and territories.

In contrast, SoilTribes promotes a vision based on shared responsibility, equitable access, and the recognition of local knowledge, prioritizing those who live on, work with, and care for the land. Restoring soils also means restoring decision-making power to communities, respecting Indigenous rights, protecting commons, and fostering inclusive governance models that keep land a living, accessible resource for current and future generations.

Only from this systemic, glocal, and territorial justice-based perspective is it possible to regenerate soils and build a sustainable future for all forms of life.

## **Resources and Alliances for Lasting Impact**

SoilTribes does not propose isolated interventions but long-term transformation processes. To this end, it mobilizes educational resources, digital platforms, cooperation networks, and experimentation spaces to strengthen the resilience of communities and ecosystems.

It has established a **Community of Practice (CoP)**—a collaborative platform designed to bring together stakeholders from various sectors to advance soil sustainability, share knowledge, and co-develop innovative solutions.

The CoP is organized into thematic working groups addressing specific soil sustainability challenges, with flexible formats allowing members to contribute based on their expertise and interests. Regular workshops, meetings, and a central platform support collaboration and knowledge exchange within these groups.

Additionally, it will develop **Stewardship Assemblies (SAs)**—spaces for implementing citizen-led, place-based solutions to local soil challenges. Through its glocal approach with regional SAs—combining global vision with local action—SoilTribes will create new educational tools, artistic exhibitions, public campaigns, and participatory events.

The project is committed to cultivating a culture of soil stewardship by engaging diverse audiences, fostering cross-sector collaboration, and co-developing sustainable practices with long-lasting benefits for people and the planet. The process brings together all elements of the **quintuple helix**—government, academia, industry, civil society, and environmental organizations—to jointly develop and implement action plans tailored to the specific needs of each region.

## **The European Union as a Driver of Glocal Restoration**

Europe, through its Mission “A Soil Deal for Europe,” aims to ensure that at least 75% of soils are healthy by 2030. SoilTribes aligns with this goal, contributing from the local level to a European movement of restoration, learning, and collaboration—vital to meet global challenges and ensure fertile soils for generations to come.
