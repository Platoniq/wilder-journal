This second module, ***Facilitating the Co-Creation of Agendas and Public Policies with Those Affected*,** delves into the transformative power of emotions in public life. We explore how facilitation can become a practice of democratic care.

## **Affection, dignity and conflict**

**Political participation is not limited to a rational act;** it is also deeply shaped by emotions. A vibrant democracy must care for and facilitate emotions and feelings, reconciling all aspects of communal life, both formal structures and emotional dimensions.

Here, we refer to the political and social dimensions of what is usually kept private: affections, dignity, and conflict. **These feelings are also part of the democratic struggle—not only about what is decided, but how it feels to live together.** They lie at the core of political movements, tied to the intensity of being emotionally stirred and the capacity to spread motivation.

Thinkers such as **Chantal Mouffe,** **Cynthia Fleury** and **Alicia Valdés** analyze how emotions influence politics. All three philosophers argue that neglecting or rejecting emotions—often associated with the irrational and passionate—leads to political disaffection and the rise of reactionary ideologies. They emphasize **the need to place affection, dignity, and conflict at the center of political action.**

Along the same lines,** [Azucena Morán](https://journal.platoniq.net/es/wilder-journal-2/interviews/Descolonizaci%C3%B3n-autonom%C3%ADa-tiempo/),** an associate researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Sustainability Research, works on democratic innovations and coloniality. She argues that **democratic innovations can erase or displace traditional or Indigenous systems of autonomy, perpetuating colonial power.** This is because the Western idea of deliberation requires communities to make legible, rational demands, paying little attention to power structures and colonial processes. Morán insists that if we are to think about decolonization, we must take these communities’ demands seriously and consider the contexts in which democratic processes are to be applied.

The opposite of affection is indifference toward the persistence of coloniality. Therefore, we must respond to the current demands of these communities and explore how deliberative processes can contribute to and meet those demands—without perpetuating colonial practices.

For example, **regarding the design of the sample, different strategies can be applied, such as algorithm colonization, oversampling, and continuous evaluation and adaptation.** The first strategy involves programming the algorithm to ensure representation not only of individual demographic traits but also of intersecting identities. The second means designing the algorithm to adjust selection probabilities based on the relevance of certain demographic characteristics to the topic under discussion. Lastly, a system for continuously evaluating the algorithm’s effectiveness in promoting representation and inclusion should be implemented.

**Azucena Morán** presents a participatory process she worked on that incorporated strategies to avoid social exclusion: the *Global Assembly*, held digitally in 2021 as part of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP). To gain decision-making power at the conference, a global assembly was organized in which participants were randomly selected to proportionally represent the global population. Additionally, over 400 local community assemblies were held in 41 countries, with more than 1,300 participants whose contributions fed into this global debate.

## **Classic (and creative) ways to participate in Public Policies**

On the other hand, **[Katy Rubin](https://journal.platoniq.net/es/wilder-journal-2/interviews/katy-rubin/)**, an expert in citizen participation and founder of Theatre of the Oppressed NYC, **proposes another way to place feelings, affections, and dignity at the heart of deliberative processes: *Legislative Theatre*.** Legislative Theatre, derived from Augusto Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed, is a process of democratic participation in which communities directly affected by unjust or ineffective policies create a play based on their own experiences. This helps identify problems and collaboratively imagine potential public policies to improve the situation.

Thus, **Legislative Theatre seeks to transform imposed norms—specifically public policies—based on the belief that communities directly affected by a problem are best placed to have a voice and vote on it.** It also fosters a space for collective imagination and active reflection, resulting in real and effective public policies, as has occurred in various parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom and Brazil.

## **Social problem scripting**

To conclude the module, we propose a **second assignment:** collaboratively writing a script for a dramatization of a social issue and related public policies. The exercise is based on topics covered in class, including: housing access, migration, democracy in the classroom, deep time, climate justice, and mental health.
