In this module, the [School of Creativity and Democracy](https://www.democraciacreativa.org/) ventures into a field as fascinating as it is complex: **the relationship between research, creativity and political participation.** Under the conceptual direction of **Platoniq,** we embark on a journey where data becomes narrative, and information is translated into tools for institutional imagination. 

This is not a module about techniques, but about **creative acts that transform how we understand, feel and construct the public sphere.** A space where research was not about accumulating truths, but about **dismantling dominant fictions in order to imagine other possibilities.**

## **From data to the heart, from graphics to action**

The first session begins with an image that seems distant: a **Mesopotamian clay tablet** from 3100 BC, used to record economic transactions. **Olivier Schulbaum's** provocation is clear: since its origins, **data has been a way of governing and narrating the world. It is neither neutral nor aseptic.** It is language, and like language, it has the power to name, render invisible or transform.

From there, an exciting field of exploration opens up: **data visualisation as an aesthetic, emotional and political tool.** Quoting **Mona Chalabi,** we understood that "there is no such thing as data visualisation without emotion". Every graph, every map, every font is a choice with narrative implications.

Examples such as the exhibition *Data Displays* (which recovers **W.E.B. Du Bois**' statistical graphs to represent the African American reality in 1900) or **Valentina D'Efilippo**'s visualisation of the **#MeToo** movement show us how data can be **forms of resistance, denunciation and empowerment**.

## **Civio: uncovering patterns, narrating injustices**

**Eva Belmonte**, director of research at **Civio**, shares how data journalism can also be a form of **citizen activism**. According to her, *"people don't consume data, they consume stories"*. That's why at Civio, **every investigation is transformed into an accessible narrative** that is emotionally powerful, capable of shaking consciences and demanding institutional accountability.

Among the examples she presents are:

* **El Indultómetro**: a visual database that shows all the pardons granted in Spain since 1996. The visualisation revealed that the most pardoned crimes were not those that appeared to be (robbery, theft), but **crimes committed by civil servants** such as prevarication or embezzlement. The investigation not only denounced this, it **led to an effective reduction in the use of pardons**.
* **Medicamentalia**: a project that shows global inequality in access to medicines.
* **Video game on nationality**: which puts the user in the shoes of a person trying to obtain European nationality, to experience the administrative maze in an immersive way.

All of this can be summed up in a phrase that defines Civio's spirit: *"We want the administration to feel observed"*. Because well-presented data **not only informs, it also makes people uncomfortable, challenges them and transforms them**.

## **Creative processing: institutions as collective fictions**

It is no longer enough to research or visualise. It is now a question of **understanding that political ideas themselves are the result of creative acts**. Democracy, the nation, rights: all these structures that seem so solid **were invented by someone, at some point**.

{% quote { "author": "Olivier Schulbaum" } %}Once upon a time, in a noisy and forgetful city, a group of young people found a broken sculpture in the square. It was not made of stone but of stories, struggles and invisible threads{% endquote %}

That sculpture was nothing other than **democracy**, built collectively, in constant tension, always incomplete.

## **History of political creativity: art, identity and resistance**

Together with **Paola Pierri**, we embark on an exciting journey through historical examples of **aesthetic research and political production**:

In **classical Athens**, the theatre was a space for deliberation.
During the **Enlightenment**, **Goya** used art to denounce tyranny.
In **Mexican muralism**, artists such as **Aurora Reyes** painted rights, classes and collective memories.
In the 20th century, **Boal**, **Beuys**, **Jenny Holzer** and the **Guerrilla Girls** occupied public space with uncomfortable, ironic and powerful art.

As the image shows, in recent decades, groups such as **Domestic Data Streamers** have turned abstract information into sensory experiences for citizen participation. These examples demonstrated that creativity is not a luxury. **It is a political necessity.**

## **The theory of political creativity**

**Paola Pierri** asserts that unlike artistic creativity (which can be personal, expressive, individual), political creativity:

Is **collective** in intention and effect.
Produces **institutions, processes, shared ideas**.
Is based on **collective fictions**, as defined by **Benedict Anderson** or **Ezrahi**.
Only works if it **achieves representation, rituals and audiences**.

Political creativity can be **progressive or conservative**. It can be used to **expand rights** (as the suffragettes did), or to **sustain the status quo** with new fictions that legitimise it.

"Democracy, he says, **cannot survive without creativity**. Because all its ideas, rules and structures are ultimately products of the collective imagination."

## **Developing a citizen participation process. Step 4: Visualise your data**

Platoniq proposes a **creative and provocative exercise**: turning a data visualisation into a **legislative theatre** scene. The goal: **to move from data to emotion**, and from there to deliberation.

Each group chooses a set of data on a public injustice, reads it critically (what does it show? what does it hide? who does it leave out?) and then creates a short scene—in the form of a dialogue, monologue, choral narration or fictional interview—that ends with an **open question to the audience**. A radical way of reminding us that **democracy is not only debated: it is also represented, felt, acted upon**. Because sometimes, a theatre scene can do more for public understanding than ten graphs.

**Researching is not about recounting what exists**, but **asking what could be different**. That **creating is not about embellishing politics**, but **establishing it**. And that **democratic participation can only be real if it is also represented, dramatised, imagined and felt**.
