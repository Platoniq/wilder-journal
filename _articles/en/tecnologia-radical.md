In a context where digital technology is rapidly transforming the way we live, organize and participate, the third module of the School of Creativity and Democracy, **Radical Technologies: Digital Democracy for a Broken World**, leads us to reflect on a key dilemma: are we using new tools to do the same old politics?

## **New tools for the same old politics**

**Olivier Schulbaum,** Strategic Director of Platoniq, opens with an evocative background image and an activity that already hints at the critical and playful tone of the meeting: **Are you rock (citizenship/social movements), paper (policy makers), or scissors (governments)?** A direct way to talk about alliances, tensions, and power structures. And a crucial warning: **many participatory platforms, such as Decidim, are born from institutions, not from the affected individuals.** Therefore, the risk is real: **reproducing traditional power structures in "new" digital formats.**

## **Fractal democracy: political architecture of the 21st century**

In this context, **Marta Poblet,** research director at The Data Tank, proposes a new way of understanding democratic synergy: **fractal democracy.**

In contrast to the “techno-feudalism” described by **Yanis Varufakis,** an era in which large digital platforms exercise a new economic and political dominance based on the massive extraction of personal data, Poblet proposes another vision: **a political architecture in which democratic principles are replicated recursively at multiple scales.** From the local to the global, passing through multiple intermediate layers (families, neighborhoods, communities, networks).

Inspired by figures such as **Condorcet, Eleanor Ostrom and Aristotle** himself, Poblet claims that **collective intelligence was not born with the internet** and that **politics is not scale-free.** As **Nassim Taleb** says, a political system cannot be evaluated without specifying its scale: **the macro and the micro feed back on each other and reproduce structures in a fractal way.**

Participatory spaces, as Poblet demonstrates, are already hybrid: they combine the physical and the digital, the institutional and the informal. From constitutional processes such as that of **Mexico City** to social movements such as **Catalan independence**, democratic participation today takes place between screens and streets. But, as he reminds us, the **choice of platforms is never neutral**: it has political, social and ethical consequences.

## **Care and safe digital spaces: from refuge to resistance**

The second session of the module invites us to explore a vital but often overlooked aspect: **the affective and political dimension of digital spaces.** Led by **Nadia Nadesan,** a researcher with the Platoniq team, the class proposes a shift in focus: it is no longer just about technology and structures, but about **bodies, dignity, emotions and resistance.**

{% gallery { "simple": true, "images": [{"path":"/media/image-4-ago-2025-09_54_12.png"}] } %}

We start from a fundamental idea: **safe spaces are not bubbles**, but **structures that are necessary for certain people to exist and express themselves without violence**. Nadesan traces the historical origins of these spaces to **queer, feminist and anti-racist struggles**, from the gay bars of Los Angeles in the 1960s to breastfeeding support groups and hairdressers for black women. These spaces were not neutral or risk-free places, but **tactical refuges where collective power and shared dignity were woven together**.

Today, many of these spaces have been displaced or rebuilt in the digital environment. But it is becoming clear to us: **the internet is not only a field of freedom**, it is also one of surveillance, censorship and structural violence.

## **The internet: between liberation and control**

The class takes an in-depth look at the **EROTICS** project, led by the international network **APC**, which investigates how people who are most vulnerable to regulatory systems experience the internet: young women, LGTBIQ+ people, people with disabilities, among others. In countries such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal, the internet is often the **only space where they can claim their rights**, explore their identities or build communities. But it is also an environment full of **invisible barriers**: family control, precarious infrastructure, gender-based violence, cultural or linguistic censorship.

{% quote %}Access to digital devices does not guarantee freedom or security of expression. Class, gender, location, language, caste, or disability{% endquote %}

Thus, it is clear that access to digital devices **does not guarantee freedom or security of expression**. **Class, gender, location, language, caste, or disability** profoundly condition the type of digital experience a person can have. Often, anonymity, informal networks of trust, and careful use of content are survival strategies.

As Nadesan argues, **the need for safe spaces arises from the fact that no one can live under constant surveillance**. And although certain sectors accuse these spaces of being "minefields" where there is no debate, the truth is that **they are not echo chambers**, but environments of empathy, listening and shared power.

## **AlgoRace: when violence is encoded in data**

Our next guest, **Youseff M. Ouled**, journalist and coordinator of the **AlgoRace** project, which addresses the most brutal and opaque side of the digital dimension: **algorithmic violence**. AlgoRace was created to denounce how **artificial intelligence and automated systems are reproducing structural racism** under the guise of technological efficiency.

From biased police data collection to the use of drones and sensors at borders, to predictive surveillance of migrants, the picture is clear: **AI is the same old racism, with new tools**.

{% gallery { "simple": true, "images": [{"path":"/media/cubo_final.jpg"}] } %}

Youseff explains how **criminal prediction systems**, such as Eurocop or Data Web, are based on historically biased data, creating a cycle in which non-white bodies are disproportionately monitored and criminalised. This is no accident: **technology is designed, programmed and applied in contexts marked by power hierarchies**.

Furthermore, the colonial dimension of technology cannot be overlooked: **the resources needed to build and power these systems often come from impoverished former colonies**, where the extraction of materials and waste management have serious environmental impacts.

## **Weaving resistance, inhabiting the internet**

Against this backdrop, **not everything is dystopian**. As the session highlights, response networks are emerging: collectives such as **ResistencIA, Grupo Semilla, Liken, IA Ciudadana and the Red de Autodefensa Feminista Online** (Online Feminist Self-Defence Network), which work from the perspective of **intersectionality, cyberactivism and ethical hacking** to challenge digital power.

These networks create campaigns, training materials, political advocacy and spaces for support in both digital and face-to-face environments. They do so from the recognition that **virtual spaces are not divorced from the real world**, and that the struggle for a fair internet is inseparable from **the struggles for social, climate, racial and gender justice**.

## **Developing a citizen participation process. Step 3: from theory to prototype**

The module culminates in a **collaborative challenge**: to design a hybrid participatory process that responds to a democratic dilemma, integrating criteria of algorithmic justice, inclusive design, digital security and fractal logic. Using **Decidim** as the base infrastructure and tools such as **Miro**, participants deployed their creativity to imagine a digital democracy that is not extractive, but **transformative**.

**Inhabiting the internet as a safe, fair and shared space** requires critical thinking, organised affectivity, ethical structures and communities that challenge control with proposals. Because it is not just about participating, but about **radically redefining how we participate**.
