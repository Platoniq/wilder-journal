**Are We Living an ‚ÄúOppenheimer Moment‚Äù with AI?**

As part of the **Convergence of Commoners Retreat,** we explored how the intersection between digital commons, data governance, and artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining democratic participation. Between hands-on workshops, theoretical debates, and shared affective experiences, one key question emerged:‚Ä® How can we design digital infrastructures that truly support democracy, instead of reinforcing inequality and exclusion?

One of the most provocative spaces of the retreat was the **live podcast** ‚ÄúCommons, Democracy, Data Governance, and AI: Rethinking Participation in an Age of Affect and Crisis‚Äù, hosted by **Nadia Nadesan**. In this conversation, **Reema Patel** and **Kate Beecroft** offered crucial insights into the relationship between AI, governance, and participation, challenging dominant narratives around technological development and its impact on democracy.

The conversation revolved around the sense of being at a tipping point. Reema described today‚Äôs AI development as a possible ‚ÄúOppenheimer moment‚Äù‚Äîa point of no return where technological advances bring profound ethical dilemmas and uncontrollable consequences if not properly regulated.

Kate introduced a geopolitical perspective, pointing out that AI is currently dominated by a handful of tech corporations, especially in the United States. However, efforts are emerging in Europe‚Äîand particularly in Spain‚Äîto develop public-interest AI models that serve as a counterbalance to these privatizing dynamics. In this context, AI is not just a technological issue, but also one of power:‚Ä® **Who controls it, and who should control it?**

The debate expanded to the relationship between AI and the economy, tackling the danger of treating data as mere commercial assets. Reema warned that data is not just abstract information, but stories about people and communities. Failing to recognize this, AI deepens inequalities and erodes democratic freedoms, reinforcing the **surveillance capitalism model** described by Shoshana Zuboff.

Kate then guided the discussion toward the role of imagination in building alternative futures. Science fiction, she argued, has historically helped anticipate crises and generate narratives that allow us to think beyond the limits imposed by the present.

The episode closed with a provocative question:‚Ä® **Can we imagine an AI that doesn‚Äôt privatize the commons, but strengthens their collective stewardship?**

A Call to Action

The conversation concluded with a reflection on litigation, policy change, and collective action as strategies to curb the unregulated expansion of AI. Kate emphasized the need for strong regulation in Europe, while Reema insisted that AI governance cannot be left only to technologists and politicians‚Äîit must also involve those currently excluded from these spaces.

During the audience discussion, a crucial question emerged:‚Ä® Can we imagine an AI that doesn‚Äôt commodify the commons, but instead reinforces their collective governance?

The conversation reaffirmed a central idea from the retreat:‚Ä® **AI is not neutral‚Äîit is shaped by our choices, and those choices must be collective.**

## **Who Participates?**

**Reema Patel:** Expert in public participation and data governance in the UK. Co-founder of Elbon Social, where she works on public-interest AI models.‚Ä®‚Ä®

**Kate Beecroft:** Governance process designer for digital communities, with experience in blockchain and the intersection of speculative economics and fiction. She leads the Science Fiction Economics Lab, where she explores alternative futures.‚Ä®‚Ä®

## **The project**

The **Convergence of Commoners Retreat** is co-organized by the **Convergence of Commoners** group, led by David Bollier, Director of the Reinventing the Commons Program at the **Schumacher Center for a New Economics**, and the **Platoniq Foundation**, in collaboration with the **INSPIRE project.**

This retreat brings together researchers, activists, and policy designers to explore how digital commons, data governance, and artificial intelligence (AI) are redefining democratic participation. Through practical sessions, theoretical discussions, and shared affective experiences, we ask:‚Ä® How can we design digital infrastructures that truly sustain democracy, rather than deepen inequality and exclusion?
