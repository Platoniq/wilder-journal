If the **tarot** is a map of archetypes, 

the **grimoire** is the book that teaches you how to use them.

One reads the moment.

The other prepares you for what comes next.

In the second chapter of Youth Mental Health Beyond Borders, our digital grimoire. aka digital fanzine, took shape not as a summary, but as an extension of the **legislative theater crash course.** A space to hold the echoes, fragments, spells, refusals and provocations that emerged during and after the Legislative Theater process.  It picked up threads from the podcast series (Opens in new tab) developed by young people in Barcelona and Manchester, extending their voices and weaving their demands into new forms of symbolic intervention.

Historically, grimoires were **manuals of ritual and resistance**. They documented secret knowledge: formulas for protection, recipes for healing, ways to navigate hostile systems. The tarot, often bound up with these traditions, was never just a divinatory tool. It was a symbolic language for sensing power, identifying danger, and imagining possibility.

In the second chapter of *Youth Mental Health Beyond Borders*, our digital grimoire took shape not as a summary, but as an **extension of the theater**. A space to hold the echoes, fragments, spells, refusals and provocations that emerged during and after the Legislative Theater process.

Historically, grimoires were **manuals of ritual and resistance**. They documented secret knowledge: formulas for protection, recipes for healing, ways to navigate hostile systems. The tarot, often bound up with these traditions, was never just a divinatory tool. It was a symbolic language for sensing power, identifying danger, and imagining possibility.

We treated the **fanzine, podcast and visual posters** in the same way.

Each proposal discussed in the podcast (and later uploaded to the Decidim platform), especially those touching on **housing, intersectionality, and care**, found its echo in **symbolic cards, slogans, and story fragments**. But also in posters and visuals we created to be held in the air, inspired by the **direct, political, and embodied tone of Camille Aumont Carnel in her book “Être raciste, c'est quoi?”** from the [ALT Collection Series](https://openspaces.platoniq.net/link?external_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.editionsdelamartiniere.fr%2Falt) of short, powerful, and thought-provoking essays for 15–25-year-olds

We channeled that energy into a series of  **Platoniq-designed protest posters and data visualisations**, some of them inspired by famous Manchester’s band posters and album Covers including:

* “I don’t lack resilience. I lack residence.”
* “I am not an expert on racism I am an expert in all the times they tried to fuck me over”
